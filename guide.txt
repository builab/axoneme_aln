Quick Guide

Startup a ODA (24nm) project

You need the following thing before starting up the project.
Directory
	star	a directory to hold all your picked particle coordinate file
Files:
	flaDirect.txt	a file containing the flagella direction of all data set used.
	ta_myproj.txt	a file contain the tilt angle of all data set used

E.g.:
Content of flaDirect.txt
	seaurchin_01	1
	seaurchin_02	0
	seaurchin_03	0

Content of ta_seaurchin.txt
	seaurchin_01	[-96.0 -60.0 60.1]
	seaurchin_02	[-96.1 -58.9 61.2]
	seaurchin_03	[-96.0 -59.2 60.5]

Startup:
Using the AA_STARTUP.PL script, you need to provide a few parameters and the parameter file, scripts, list file will be generated automatically.

>>aa_startup.pl
Project: seaurchin
Flagella direction file: flaDirect.txt
Tilt angle file: ta_seaurchin.txt
...
...

If this is the first time you start the project, AA_STARTUP will check your star file, then generate the list file and all the necessary scripts. If the list file already exists, the script will ask you to overwrite or use it.

Generated files
List file

Parameter file
All the parameters are stored in seaurchin.param file.

Scripts
All script are stored in "bat" directory. The odaScript.bat contains all the script should be run sequentially from start to end.

Regenerating scripts:

If for some reasons e.g. changing list file, you need to regenerate the script file, you don't need to start the project again, just call the AA_SCRIPTS.PL script

>>aa_scripts.pl
..
..
..

You can choose to generate individual script or all of them.
